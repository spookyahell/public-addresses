To whom it may concern,

**please stop geoblocking ALL content intended for online viewing** (as far as possible).

It is absurd and DOES NOT effectively give you more control over your content.
<br>There is no question that this - in part - what drives and motivates users to illegaly access your content through other available means.
<br>Or to just "ask a friend" who might be willing to help.

Also: More online services and activity (due to covid19) drives up cybercrime automatically, you CAN NOT stop that logic.
<br>Not having certain titles or works available in certain regions is what drives the motivation to leak something online.

That being said, not having a service available in all countries of the world at launch of a service is somewhat understandable.
<br>However, if it takes you more than 2 years between, say... an US launch and all intended foreign launches, then you didn't do things the right way during that time.

But that too is a problem, when it comes to wanting to be among the first to watch something before it gets spoiled online for you.

Thank you for taking the time to read and understand.
